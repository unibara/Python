"""
In 1682 the German mathematician Gottfried Willhelm von Leibniz formulated the following alternating series:

1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 .. = π/4

This algorithm is called the Leibniz formula and it is an inefficent approach to calculate the digits of π (pi).

IN: the amount of iterations (int); OUT: the calculated value (float)

Usage:
>>> round(leibniz_formula_for_pi(1000000000), 3)
3.142

>>> leibniz_formula_for_pi("this_is_a_string")
ValueError: The input needs to be an integer.
